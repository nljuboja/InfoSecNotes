# Android Notes
## Android Manifest
* Exported components
  * Look for 'exported="true"' in some of the components; that means that other applications can interact with it
  * The tag "intent-filter" is automatically exported by default and there's no export flag
* Permissions
  * The signature level means that only apps with same certificate can be granted permission
## Intents
## Storage
